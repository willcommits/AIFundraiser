            <h2>Explanation Of Ideas</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                A robot is a reprogrammable, multifunctional manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools, or specialized devices through various programmed motions for the performance of a variety of task (Robot Institute of America, 1979. Robotics is that field concerned with the intelligent connection of perception to action by definition according to Micheal Brandy

                I have two ideas that will both be an immense help to hospitals and it would lessen the death rates here in South Africa and raise awareness to a lot of ignorant people about their health statuses. Another problem I aim to mitigate or lessen would be to help hospitals and clinics reduce the number of patients that are not being attended too for when the hospital is too full or when the doctors have a lot on their hands. The first idea is to use robotics to be able to diagnose a patient through the use of scanning the person's body for any illness or virus then treat them by recommending medicine or performing a surgical operation. These robots will cater for all the scans and tests that are performed by nurses and doctors as procedural things that must be checked beforehand before any other examinations are carried out.

            <p>
                So, it will be able to check whether the patient has signs of breast cancer, HIV as well as determine their temperature. With the implementation of a robotics systems like this a lot more lives will be saved and these robots can even be placed at pharmacies so they can be accessible to the public not only via hospitals. Robots are much more accurate than humans when doing a task and they would be much reliable in cases where we must perform a surgery. The robot will be able scan the whole body of a patient who has had a traumatic injury or has a problem with internal organs. So, this robot will tell if a patient has an artery that burst or what happened inside the body that has caused the internal bleeding so that the correct operation may be performed.

            <h2>Implementation of Idea</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The robots will use the human anatomy of a healthy person and compare to their patients being used on and try to diagnose if they are healthy or not. It will be pre-programmed with all the biology content that are taught to doctors so it can even be capable of identifying what the health issue actually is. Engineers and programmers are the key main players within the development of the robot.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p >
                Electrical engineer, mechatronics engineer and Computer Science graduates will be the key players within the development of the robot on developing the physical structure of the robot and as well pre-programming the robot to think and move within a specific way. There is also a need for doctors because their expertise in the medical field will be very much needed to ensure the robots are working at full capacity. 

                The stake holders of the idea will be the companies who would have invested within the idea and companies and people will be given an opportunity to make contributions to the idea via the website where they can enter their card details.

                Potential investors and companies to be approached will be companies like Aspen, Invest Tech and Discovery. These companies have influence within the medical sector will Invest Tech is a big bank that will be able to invest a lot into making the idea a reality. The department of health in south Africa will also be one of the potential target market to attract to invest into the company as they basically run the medical sector in South Africa.
